# API Automation QA Test

Welcome to the API Automation QA Test project! This project demonstrates how to perform automated testing of RESTful APIs using C#, Xunit, and the Moq library.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you clone the project and set it up on your local machine for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (or any C# development environment)
- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Git

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.

3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Pubzzz/API_Automation_QATest.git

## Building the Project

1. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment.

2. Build the project by selecting "Build" from the menu or using the keyboard shortcut (e.g., F6).

## Running the Tests
1. The project contains a set of automated tests that can be executed to test the API. To run the tests:

2. Open the Test Explorer in Visual Studio by selecting "Test" > "Test Explorer" from the menu.

3. In the Test Explorer, you will see a list of available tests.

4. Click the "Run All" button to execute all the tests.

Note: You can also run tests individually by right-clicking on a specific test and selecting "Run Selected Tests."
The test results will be displayed in the Test Explorer, showing which tests passed or failed.

## Test Configuration
In the project code, the API endpoints are mocked using the Moq library. You can configure the mock responses for each API request in the test methods. For details, please refer to the code comments and the Moq library documentation.
